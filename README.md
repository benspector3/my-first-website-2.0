## Setup
### Revisiting your First Website

The goal of this project is to spruce up our first website by creating a new `<div>` (from scratch!) and adding some jQuery to that section. Let's get started, shall we?

1.  Open up your first-website workspace on cloud9 (http://c9.io)
2.  Open up the `index.html` file for first website. Make sure you've chosen index.html for the website, not any of your other projects. You can assure this by closing the projects folder. The correct `index.html` file will be at the bottom of the file list.

That's it! You're ready to make your website swanky.
